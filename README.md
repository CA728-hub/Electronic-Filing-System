# Electronic-Filing-System
This is a prototype of an electronic filing system developed for a private business to streamline file storage processes. The system aims to eliminate the need for manually creating folders and organizing information by automating these tasks. This sample demonstrates the system's core functionality, with further development planned for a complete implementation.

-- In the folder are the Admin Filing System and Client Filing System.

-- In the Admin System Folder the files are created in here and then converted to a PDF and placed inside client system folders.
All creation and changes take place here.

-- In the Client System Folder the files are in a PDF format for viewing-only. This is for when a recorded file needs to be
retrieved and pulled up. It keeps the whole electronic filing system easier to use and not cluttered. 

-- The PrototypeGUI.exe is the GUI system that automates the creation of new file documents. It is just a pure sample to give an idea
of what it will do once the full eletronic system is completed. To use just double click and type out the information it asks, a new 
folder will then be created with the name and information you gave it. 

-- If any errors occur with the PrototypeGUI.exe file, move the Electronic Filing System folder to your desktop and it should work. 

-- The ElectronicFilingPresentation video here shows how everything works, I highly recommend to watch it.
